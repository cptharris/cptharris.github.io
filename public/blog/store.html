    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, a very fancy web developer. Welcome to my website!<br><br>

        I just finished <em>completely</em> redesigning my entire website! I'm super fancy because I
        decided to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16"
                height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-bootstrap-fill" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

        to improve the styling and make this website mobile-friendly. Ideally, if you're viewing this
        page on a device that is smaller than a computer monitor, you can still navigate and see the
        content easily, especially since I spent 3 days working on it.<br><br>

        Rewriting basically the whole website was a lot of work, but I'm quite pleased with the result.
        Doesn't this page look a lot more modern and smooth? There's even a redesigned header ⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆ and
        a brand new footer ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇!<br><br>

    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, the programmer with expanding knowledge. Welcome to my website!<br><br>

        I continue to improve and fix <a href="/TechieCableUtilities">TechieCableUtilities</a>, my
        experimental program written in <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey</a>, an
        automation scripting language for Windows. Take a look at the <a href="/TechieCableUtilities">feature page</a>
        that
        I recently added to display some helpful
        information.<br><br>

        Recently, I've also been working more on this website. I now use <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> to
        load a
        separate HTML page onto this one to display
        things like the page navigation and <s>last updated badge</s>.<br><br>

        I also <em>finally</em> figured out how to load these blog posts from a remote source so that I
        can more easily create and update them. You're reading this, so I guess it worked.<br><br>

    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, the forward-moving programmer. Welcome to my website!<br><br>

        I am still writing scripts with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey</a>, an
        automation scripting language for Windows. In fact, I brought together a few different scripts
        that I had written to make TechieCableUtilites. Written entirely in AutoHotkey, it features an
        installer, launcher, updater, and the program itself.<br><br>

        The launcher/updater tool automatically retrieves the latest release of the compiled script from
        my <a href="https://github.com/TechieCable/TechieCableUtilities">Github repository</a> and
        launches it. A little tray icon allows for easy user interaction and the script adds in some
        hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) for a few useful things.<br><br>

        For more information, check out the <a href="/TechieCableUtilities">feature page for
            TechieCableUtilities</a><br><br>

    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, an ever-improving programmer. Welcome to my website!<br><br>

        Right now, I am writing scripts with <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a>, an
        automation scripting language. I've also recently been working on writing this website.<br><br>

        I can't announce that I am completely finished yet, but it's coming along quite nicely. To
        start, I decided that I wanted a full-screen front page. While such a thing may sound simple, it
        took a lot of trial and mostly error to make it happen. However, after much research and more
        coding in both HTML and CSS, I now have that front page that I was looking for.<br><br>

        I've also been rewriting and transfering my programs from my old <a href="https://sites.google.com">Google
            Sites</a>
        page. You can view a list of <a href="programs">all my published programs</a> here on this site.<br><br>

        You might have noticed the header at the top of your page (the bar with links to my <a href="/">home page</a>
        and <a href="programs">programs page</a>). If you scroll down, it
        should travel with you. If not, I have more research to do.<br><br>

        Regardless, more is coming to this site in the near future! Thanks for visiting!<br><br>

    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, a learning programmer. Welcome to my website!<br><br>

        Currently, I am writing Processing JavaScript programs, simple HTML web pages, and spicing those
        web pages up with some CSS styling. I recently wrote a few programs centered around
        time.<br><br>

        Have you ever wondered exactly how many days it has been since your last birthday? The start of
        the year? <time datetime="0000-00-00">00/00/0000</time>? I wrote a program that can calculate
        all of those, and more. Below you will see a program that I wrote specifically to show how many
        days have passed since a user-specified date. It basically calculates how many days there are
        between the user date and <time datetime="0000-00-00">00/00/0000</time>. Then it finds today's
        date and calculates the number of days between that and <time datetime="0000-00-00">00/00/0000</time>. Finally,
        it
        subtracts days since user date from
        today date and shows the viewer the output. I put it in a nice block of text so the user can see
        the outcome. To select the user-specified date, I made several buttons for switching between
        menus and increasing/decreasing the values.<br><br>

        You can view a list of <a href="programs">all my published programs</a> or see <a href="programs\days_since">my

        some areas. It basically calculates how many days there were between <time>3/13/2020</time> and

    <p>Hey! I'm TechieCable, an actively learning programmer. Welcome to my website! Let me tell you a
        bit about myself.<br><br>

        As of now, I can write very basic JavaScript programs, simplistic HTML web pages, and a bit of
        CSS styling. I created my first program, <a href="program\click_counter">Click Speed
            Counter</a>, as an experiment to test my learning. While creating it, I developed a system
        for measuring time inside a JavaScript program. Now I can assign a variable for the start time,
        current time, remaining time, and elapsed time in a program. With this knowledge, I can make
        individual objects or text appear on the page after a specified amount of time. For example, in
        my second program, <a href="programs\space_invaders">Space Invaders</a>, the game has a
        five-second countdown from when you hit the start button to when you are redirected to play the
        game.<br><br>

        I hope to continue to learn more and practice my skills by posting fun games and useful
        utilities on this site. You can view <a href="programs">list of all my published programs</a> or
        see <a href="programs\space_invaders">my latest release</a> <s>(also shown just after this
            letter)</s>.<br><br>
